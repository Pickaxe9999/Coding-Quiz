# Coding-Quiz

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
